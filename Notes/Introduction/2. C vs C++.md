C programming Language|C++ Programming Language
----------------------|-------------------------------
C was developed by Dennis Ritchie between the year 1969 and 1973 at AT&T Bell Labs | C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979
C does no support polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance which means that C does not support object oriented programming|	C++ supports polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance because it is an object oriented programming language.
C is a subset of C++.|	C++ is a superset of C.
C contains 32 keywords.|	C++ contains 52 keywords.
For the development of code, C supports procedural programming.|	C++ is known as hybrid language because C++ supports both procedural and object oriented programming paradigms.
Data and functions are separated in C because it is a procedural programming language.|	Data and functions are encapsulated together in form of an object in C++.
C does not support information hiding.|	Data is hidden by the Encapsulation to ensure that data structures and operators are used as intended.
Built-in data types is supported in C.|	Built-in & user-defined data types is supported in C++.
C is a function driven language because C is a procedural programming language.|	C++ is an object driven language because it is an object oriented programming.
Function and operator overloading is not supported in C.|	Function and operator overloading is supported by C++.
C is a function-driven language.|	C++ is an object-driven language
Functions in C are not defined inside structures.|	Functions can be used inside a structure in C++.
Namespace features are not present inside the C.|	Namespace is used by C++, which avoid name collisions.
Header file used by C is stdio.h.|	Header file used by C++ is iostream.h.
Reference variables are not supported by C.|	Reference variables are supported by C++.
Virtual and friend functions are not supported by C.|	Virtual and friend functions are supported by C++.
C does not support inheritance.|	C++ supports inheritance.
Instead of focusing on data, C focuses on method or process.|	C++ focuses on data instead of focusing on method or procedure.
C provides malloc() and calloc() functions for dynamic memory allocation, and free() for memory de-allocation.|	C++ provides new operator for memory allocation and delete operator for memory de-allocation.
Direct support for exception handling is not supported by C.|	Exception handling is supported by C++.
scanf() and printf() functions are used for input/output in C.|	cin and cout are used for input/output in C+.
